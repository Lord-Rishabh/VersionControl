To check status for your project. Use : git status
To check status with short message. Use : git status -s
There are 4 stages : 
    1. Untracked
    2. Unmodified
    3. Modified
    4. Staged(committed)

For converting file from stage 1 to 2. Use : git add fileName

To commit a file, follow this steps : 
1. git commit
2. A vim editor will open. Then press 'i'
3. Type your commit message
4. Press ESC and type ':wq'.
Note : Before committing a file, we need to add it using git add, then only we can commit
       a file.

You can make a file using : touch fileName
To add all the files use : git add -A   ;Use capital A only

If we modify a file after adding it, then git status will show modified file. Also this
modification is not added. To add them use : git add fileName .

To commit directly use : git commit -m "commitMessage". Here also modified file will not
get committed until it is added using above command.
Now, To commit without adding file to staging area 
use : git commit -a -m "Skipped staging area"


If you want to see all commits that you made use : git log. In case you want to see last
1 commits use : git log -p -1. And press q to quit this log.

To compare the modified file with tracked(added) file we need to use : git diff.
To compare the last tracked(added) file with last commit use : git diff --staged.
